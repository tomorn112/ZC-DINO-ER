## ðŸ¥š ZC-DINO-ER
This repository contains the supplementary code for the journal submitted to **IEEE Access (2025)** titled:  
**"Zero-Shot Eggshell Crack Detection Using Grounding DINO and FFT-Based Outer-to-Inner Ring Energy Ratio"**

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Structure

- `dataset1_images/hen/`  
  Contains **50 hen egg trays** captured from various angles. This is the **primary dataset** used for crack vs. intact classification and model training.

- `dataset2_videos/`  
  Contains **real-world video footage** used for evaluating the robustness of the detection pipeline in dynamic, practical scenarios.

- `duck_egg_dataset/`  
  Additional dataset contributed by Bhavya Botta and Ashis Kumar Datta for real-time crack detection on duck eggs.

## ðŸ“˜ Code Structure (organized by GitHub branches)

The code is divided into **4 branches**, each representing a phase of the detection pipeline:

| Branch   | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `part1`  | ðŸ§¼ **Crop and remove background** from egg tray images using segmentation techniques |
| `part2`  | ðŸ§  Use **Grounding DINO with fine-grained prompts** and **Ring Outer/Inner Energy Ratio** to differentiate between cracked and intact eggs |
| `part3`  | ðŸ“Š **Compare** performance with traditional **supervised learning models** (e.g., CNN, SVM) and **segmentation models** |
| `part4`  | ðŸŽ¥ Perform **real-world video testing** using `dataset2_videos` to evaluate generalizability and inference speed |

## ðŸ”§ Requirements & Dependencies

Each branch includes its own notebook and environment, but the general requirements include:

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- Grounding DINO
- OpenCV
- scikit-learn
