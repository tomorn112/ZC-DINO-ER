# ZC-DINO-ER
This repository contains the supplementary code for the journal submitted to IEEE Access (2025) titled: "Zero-Shot Eggshell Crack Detection Using Grounding DINO and FFT-Based Outer-to-Inner Ring Energy Ratio

ðŸ¥š Hen Egg Crack Detection Project
This project focuses on detecting cracks in hen eggs using a combination of traditional computer vision techniques, vision-language models, and supervised learning. The dataset and code are organized to support clear experimentation and development.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset Structure
dataset1_images/hen/
Contains 50 hen egg trays captured from various angles. This is the primary dataset used for initial crack vs. intact classification and model training.

dataset2_videos/
Contains real-world video footage used for evaluating crack detection performance in dynamic scenarios.
